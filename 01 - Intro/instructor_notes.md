# Unit Overview

## Prior to Part 1

### Interactive Session (15 minutes)

- Listing and categorizing programming languages to groups (interpreters, jvms, functional, assembly)
- Difference between the languages
- Why is C still relevant?
- Recent years transition back to compiled languages (go, swift, rust)
- Android vs iPhone development and simulator (difference between swift to java)
- **Disclaimer:** Starting from the bottom to make sure eveyone understand

## Part 1 - Intro

- How to compile using GCC
- C Standards (ANSI vs C99)

## Part 2 - Data Types

- Difference in data type sizes, the differences between 32-bit to 64-bit (and the rationale of stdint.h)
- Discussion of bus size, why industry moved to 64-bit, demonstrating difference in pointer size
- Compiling with -m32

## Part 3 - Define & Constants

- ANSI vs C99

## Part 4 - Operators

- Bit-flags example using IP/ETH flags (if learned) or using `open` function
- Demonstrating `man` and `apropos`
  - Man Sections (`man 3 printf`)
  - How to read man (+`  -o` trick)
  - Easy apropos using `grep`


## Appendix 1 - Roi
### Why C is Awesome:
* Almost All HL languages are built on top of C (Python, Java...)
* Curiosity Rover 500k lines of C code
* Linux Kernel + Windows in C
* Since 1972 and kicking! (In top 3 most common for long time)
* Writing C will help you understand how computers work
* as a user you dont need to install packages to support it will work on any computer! (From the strongest to the shittiest)
